             <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p><img class="trimet" src="img/bus-sm.gif" alt="retro bus sketch" align="right">I've been on the Web since the dawn of time. Well almost. <span class="italics">And no, I don't believe I invented it.</span> In the early 90's I worked as an EMT in a hospital Emergency room in Portland where we retrieved medical records from OHSU via something called the Internet &mdash;this was before the World Wide Web was readily available through Web browers.  When it was slow at night, my co-workers and I would chat on Telnet bulletin boards with university students around Europe.  Around the time I found out about the Web, the hospital I worked in closed so I decided to learn HTML. Soon I was making webpages and learning about servers but unforunately there wasn't much of a market for Web Developers since few people had heard of the Internet. So I read a few networking books and went into IT for a few years. I'd set up a start-up company's network, build them a website, and then move on to the next company. Later, I found myself working in online marketing and eCommerce website management.  Though I've worked on many sites over the years, I miss the creativity and challenge of development. After deciding to upgrade my skillset, I visited several code bootcamps in Portland and chose Epicodus - even though it means two hours on the bus every day!</p>
